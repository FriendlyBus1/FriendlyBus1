Random Cultural Notes

Programming is typing, not writing.

Typing code, always fails.

Compiling code is a narrow path.

Push into Just and brassy logic.

Spiritual honesty, nowhere known.

When will we feel time?

Mice select, pull down images made.

Keyboards type, elect a pushing feeling.

Catch your reflection in a monitor.

A thousand wasted hours.
