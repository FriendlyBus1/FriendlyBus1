- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FriendlyBus1

People speak about programming in a strange fashion. They identify a problem, recursive effort put into every stage of the process. 
The first 90% of your project takes all the time, then polishing the last 10% of your project takes another 90% of the time, ect.

Then all these character and behavioural explanations of what a programmer should be or do. "Your problem is approaching the program like a middle schooler's
idea of what is finished." "That's the behaviour of some noob who is too into his own project" "You should make the shittiest code that works" ect, ect.

What you're doing is programming your way through a maze. A CPU is physically a maze of flipped bits. It may be a maze of your own creation, but you 
ultimately want the electricity to get through your instructions and not crash on a dead-end, recursive loop, index out of array bounds, ect.

The MVP/first beta/first 90% of your project, whatever you want to call it. It is getting the electricity through the maze you made. Once it has done that,
you can polish up the maze all you want, to be more performant, to iterate on the idea, to be bug-free, to be smaller in size, ect, ect.

That electric path is really what the program is, at the end of the day.

None of the fancy language around the problem really matters until you know the way through that intitial maze. 
None of the relationships you want this program to enhance, really matter until you know the way through that initial maze. 
There is no aha! moment at the end of the program. There is gasping relief you and your electricity made it through the problem
space...

You cannot finish a program. Nobody can design the perfect maze. You are a soldier who wants relief from the war 
against Mathematics. Hopefully you will be relieved by the end-user who buys and submits to using the mathematic
path you tore down from the Logic God for them.

Kind Regards,

Bus.
